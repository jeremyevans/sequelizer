# A normal database.yml file contains a file with many different database
# configurations specified, one for each "environment".
#
# This is a Rails convention, but frankly, most of the time I have a single
# environment in my one-off scripts and don't want to bother with specifying
# different environments.
#
# So I can just define my database options like so:
---
adapter: postgres # Note: postgresql also works, but Sequel prefers postgres
database: my_database
host: localhost
username: my_user
password: my_great_password
